# Large data files (if you don't want to track them or use Git LFS)
# If your CSV catalog is very large, consider adding it here:
# california_earthquake_catalog_M2+_1990_Present.csv

# Saved models (if they are very large and you don't use Git LFS)
# If your .joblib files are causing issues, you might add them here,
# but generally for ML projects, you DO want to track models.
# If you get errors about file size, look into Git LFS.
